## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MetaMask wallet
- Ethereum testnet ETH (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/contractguard.git
cd contractguard
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

4. Start the backend server
```bash
node src/backend/server.js
```

5. Start the frontend development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

```env
# Required for AI analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Required for contract data fetching
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here

# Optional - Database URL if using persistent storage
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

# Server configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

The payment contract is located in `src/contracts/AuditPay.sol`. To deploy:

1. Install Hardhat or Foundry
2. Configure network settings
3. Deploy the contract
4. Update the contract address in the frontend

## Architecture

### Frontend Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # React components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # API and Web3 services
â”œâ”€â”€ types/             # TypeScript definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/         # Smart contract files
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx           # Main application
```

### Payment Flow
1. User submits contract address
2. System fetches and analyzes contract
3. Free report displayed immediately
4. Premium features require payment via MetaMask
5. Smart contract verifies payment
6. Full report unlocked for user

### Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling
- **Input Validation**: Address and input sanitization
- **Secure Payments**: On-chain payment verification
- **Data Privacy**: User data protection

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/audit
Analyze a smart contract
```json
{
  "contractAddress": "0x...",
  "includeSource": true
}
```

### GET /api/audit/:address
Retrieve audit results
```json
{
  "contractAddress": "0x...",
  "riskScore": 75,
  "vulnerabilities": [...],
  "isPaid": true
}
```
